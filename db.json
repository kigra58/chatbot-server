      "response": "There's no officially documented \"Vercel v0\".  Vercel (formerly Zeit) didn't have a numbered version like \"v0\" in its history.  The platform evolved gradually from its initial conception and deployment.  \n\nWhile there isn't a specific \"v0,\" we can talk about the very early stages of what became Vercel:\n\n* **Zeit's origins were rooted in Now.sh:** This was the original service, focusing on incredibly simple serverless deployments.  It was known for its ease of use (often a single `now deploy` command) and its speed.  This period represents the foundation of what Vercel is today.  The features were significantly more limited than the current Vercel offering.  Think basic static site hosting with serverless functions.  It lacked many of the advanced features like edge functions, preview deployments, and robust analytics available today.\n\n* **Focus on Simplicity and Developer Experience:** From the start, the focus was on a smooth developer experience.  The command-line interface and the overall deployment process were designed for minimal friction.  This commitment to simplicity is still a core tenet of the Vercel platform.\n\n* **Gradual Feature Additions:**  Over time, Zeit (and later Vercel) iteratively added features, expanding beyond simple static hosting to include more sophisticated serverless functions, database integrations, and deployment workflows.  This wasn't a sudden \"v1\" release, but a continuous evolution.\n\nIn short, instead of a \"v0,\" think of the earliest days of Vercel as a nascent, yet powerful, serverless deployment platform with a strong emphasis on developer experience, which iteratively developed into the comprehensive platform we know today.  There are no publicly available release notes or documentation reflecting such a \"v0\" stage.\n",
